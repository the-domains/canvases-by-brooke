# Summertime Babes
![16x20 full color acrylic/watercolor](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/672c76c0-5b69-43b1-8d95-bd7ea3d94dca.jpg)

Summer is for babies!! But really, babies are EVERYWHERE right now. I guess it was just a matter of time before I painted one! This was for a client a couple weeks ago who wanted to capture her 10 month old baby girl in a portrait. 

Details: Full color acrylic/watercolor on 16x20 canvas
