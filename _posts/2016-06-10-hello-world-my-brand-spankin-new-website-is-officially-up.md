  Hello world! My brand spankin’ new website is officially up and running! In
  case you're new to the site and to what I do, I’m a portrait/concept artist
  located in the Portland area. I've been painting professionally since 2011,
  but drawing has been one of my biggest passions since I received my first box
  of Crayolas. I have a deep love for comic style concept art and well as any
  family, dog, cat, horse, baby, chicken, fruit,
  pretty-much-anything-your-heart-desires portrait on canvas. Take a gander at
  my recent works and consider ordering a custom painting for yourself or a
  loved one! My prices range from $45-$200 depending on how large/intricate a
  painting will be!
